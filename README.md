# LambdaMART Implementation

This project implements the LambdaMART algorithm for learning to rank. LambdaMART is a variant of MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees) that uses a specialized loss function for ranking tasks. The goal is to train a model that can order a set of items (e.g., documents, products) based on their relevance to a given query.

## Key Concepts

- Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) or Multiple Additive Regression Trees (MART):
  - Ensemble Method: GBDT combines multiple decision trees to make a prediction.
  - Sequential Training: Trees are built sequentially, with each new tree trying to correct the errors of the previous trees.
  - Gradient Descent: The "gradient" part refers to using gradient descent to optimize the model's parameters.
- LambdaRank:
  - Ranking-Specific Loss: LambdaRank is a way to adapt gradient descent for ranking. Instead of directly optimizing for a single prediction, it focuses on the relative order of items.
  - Lambdas: LambdaRank calculates "lambdas," which are pseudo-gradients that indicate how much the score of an item should change to improve its ranking relative to other items.
- LambdaMART: LambdaRank + MART: LambdaMART combines the LambdaRank loss function with MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees).

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Main implementation of the LambdaMART algorithm.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the LambdaMART implementation:
```python

# Initialize the LambdaMART model
model = LambdaMART()

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
```
